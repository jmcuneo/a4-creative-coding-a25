# Interactive Particle System

Render link: https://a4-rohittallapragada-n1u4.onrender.com/

## Project Summary

An interactive particle system built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The particles move around the screen and can be interacted with.

## Goal of the Application

The goal was to create an engaging interactive web application where users can control the particles' movements and properties as a way of showing client-side JavaScript capabilities and Canvas API usage.

## Challenges Faced

The main challenges included:
- Implementing smooth particle physics without awkwardness
- Creating a real time system where you can change the particles while the website is running
- Handling edge collision detection to keep particles within bounds instead of going offscreen

## Instructions

1. Move your mouse around the screen to attract particles to the cursor.
2. Use the control panel on the left to adjust:
   - **Count**: Number of particles (10-200)
   - **Speed**: How fast particles move (0.5-10)
   - **Size**: Particle radius (1-10 pixels)
   - **Color**: Particle color (color picker)
   - **Attraction**: How strongly particles are attracted to your mouse cursor (0-300)
