https://a4-aaron-waller.vercel.app/

The goal of this application the application is to provide a web application in which a user can play on a virtual keyboard. 
Additionally, the goal of the application is to give the user the ability to control the sounds produced by the keyboard,
mainly through control of volume, octave, and wave type (smoothness). The primary challenge that was faced as part of the design 
process was the confusing documentation for Web Audio Api and Nexus UI as it made debugging issues challenging. Additionally, 
another challenge in creating the application was designing the ideal structures to store data and contain functions.
