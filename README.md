## CS4241 Assignment 4 -- Editable Audio Visualizer

http://a4-charlieroberts.glitch.me

My project is a simple one -- an audio visualizer that the user can customize. The goal of this application is to allow a user to change different features of the visualizer, including oscilator toggle, color options for multiple aspects, toggle to flip the visualizer, and the weight of the lines of the visualizer. The user can load it using a preloaded song (Samsung's Over The Horizon (I just happened to have that file on my PC)), or they can upload their own audio file.

The button must be pressed to start the visualizer, but you can change the file you want mid-song and it will automatically play.

I luckily did not encounter many issues while creating this application. My biggest issue was honestly deciding what features to make adjustable. I decided that in addition to frequency analyzer, I'd also add a time analyzer (with the help of an mdn example, and inspired by this example: https://webaudioapi.com/samples/visualizer/). It was also kind of confusing to implement the file upload at first, but only for a little, a w3schools example made me realize how simple it is.
