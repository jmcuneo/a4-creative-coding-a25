Assignment 4 - Creative Coding: Interactive Multimedia Experiences
===
## Falling Bricks Game
A simple 3D browser-based game built with Three.js, where the player controls a cone-shaped character on a square ground plane. Falling blocks/bricks spawn randomly from above, and the player must dodge them to survive. The game tracks score based on survival time (seconds), includes pause and restart functionality, and allows players to adjust settings like ground size, player speed, block speed, and spawn rate via sliders. A leaderboard displays the player names and local session-based high scores dynamically. The game runs in real-time with basic collision detection, lighting, and shadows to enhance the 3D experience.

Baseline Requirements
---

My application (game) has all of the following functionalities:
- A simple Express server that delivers the index.html and static files, acting purely as a frontend host without any backend functionality.
- A client-side interactive experience using Three.js for 3D graphics.
- A user interface for interaction with my game, which exposes four parameters for user control (ground size, player speed, block speed, and spawn rate). There is a slider box that allow these values to be controlled.
- My application displays basic documentation for the user interface when the application first loads. There is a welcome box and enter name prompt to play. In the bottom right there are instructions on how to play the game.
