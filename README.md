## Catch the Falling Objects Game

your hosting link e.g. https://a4-ayushkulkarni.onrender.com/

The goal of this application is to play a game where the user attempts to catch falling objects (spheres) in a basket. This is a simple 3D game where the user controls that basket using arrow keys or mouse movement to align the basket with the falling objects. The score is the amount of objects in a row the user successfully catches. Various settings can be adjusted, such as the basket color, speed, and size of the falling objects.

Challenges I faced when realizing this application were with the bounds of the basket and where the falling objects can be located in the 3D space. Mouse movements for a 3D space and making the game look 3D were also challenging.
There are a couple of known issues with this application. The bounds of the basket movement and falling objects are fixed values, so the game may not be fit to play on all screen sizes. The bounds of the basket and falling objects may differ slightly, so some objects become impossible to catch. Lastly, the speed is captured as any number value, so entering negative numbers will break the application and entered values may make the game impossible to play (or add a challenging aspect depending on the user).

When the "settings" menu is used to adjust any field, please click off of the gray box by clicking anywhere on the white space of the page before making any mouse and arrow key inputs. Failure to do so will result in the fields being adjusted while the basket moves, and the game will not work as intended.

Have Fun!
