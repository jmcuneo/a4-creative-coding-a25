I followed a tutorial on youtube to create a audio visualizer using threejs. https://youtu.be/qDIF2z_VtHs?si=9XmV8smE7waWC5pt

- I wanted to learn something creative and I have always wanted to learn threejs. I used this tutorial because I didn't quite know where to start but I really liked the formatting of the tutorial and was able to add my own things to it and remove the stuff I wasn't really looking to learn. 
- The tutorial used parcel, which I didnt really know how to use. So I was able to remove it and implement express so that i could run the application easier.
- to run locally
    - npm install
    - npm run dev 
    - you can click play and pause on the bottom left corner to control the music
    - you can change sizing and colors that the visualizer shows on the top right, feel free to mess around with it!
