## Simple Music App

https://a4-ethanshanbaum.onrender.com/

The goal of this project is to provide a simple music interface for users to test out the effect that octave and oscillator type have on the Web Audio API. The user can test the audio by playing the keyboard themselves or having a test clip of Ode to Joy play. The challenges I faced included learning about the Web Audio API as well as styling. The keyboard supports both mouse and keyboard controls.
