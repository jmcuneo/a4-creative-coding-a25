## Blocky Domain 2.0

Yes, this is 2.0. I made this project at my Junior year of highschool. Now being a junior in college, I thought it'd be funny to recreate it into something better. The old one was hosted on replit for a long time before it became a vibecoding app (good times)

Anyways, the project simply shows a collection of blocks placed in random positions. You can drag your mouse to rotate the camera around to orbit the blocks. There's also a form on the top left where you can run the simulation with more or less blocks, different color themes, or with a change in behavior of the blocks.

The most challenging part in creating the application was handling the changes when the form submits. There's a lot that needed to be changed (Blocks, Light Colors, etc) to ensure that the changes went through so I had to really think on the implementations. 

Another challenging part was getting started on it, I had HUGE troble trying to think around the camera, controls and the lights.
