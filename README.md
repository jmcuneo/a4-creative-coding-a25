## A4-Owen-Hart: Missile Command-like Game

My Render: https://a4-owenhart-a25.onrender.com

This project was based on the old Atari game "Missile Command". I believe this project was complex enough to fit the project 
requirements, as it had a couple complications. The first being while canvas.js is easy to use, it is more challenging to draw complex
shapes, so the terrain took a little while. The second challenge was in some of the game logic, checking distances and collisions while making
the game difficulty progressively harder.

The user interface consists of a start button, clicking the canvas for controlling the game, and a couple input values before starting.
The inputs I think are self explanatory except the frame rate, which affects how fast missile waves come out. Higher rate, makes waves slower,
lower rate makes them faster. This is in case the browser runs faster than 60Hz, though I don't think most do.
