## Digital Synth

your hosting link e.g. [http://a4-charlieroberts.glitch.me](https://a4-olivia-olsen.onrender.com/)

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged when needed, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include the following:

- the goal of the application
The goal of this application was to create a digital synth with multiple manipulable factors that effect sound.
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
Nothing worked first try, even the parts I assumed would be easy. Documentation on Tone.js and interface.js were extremely sparse from what I could find, and formatting was difficult to figure out. Finally, as a last kick in the ribs, both git and render failed so badly that I had to have three more CS majors help me troubleshoot them.
- the instructions you present in the website should be clear enough to use the application, but if you feel any need to provide additional instructions please do so here.
I feel that the website in itself is intuitive enough to stand without instruction, but one additional fun fact is that it can also be controlled with the bottom row of letter keys, with some of the middle row acting as black keys.
