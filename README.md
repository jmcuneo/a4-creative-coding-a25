## a4-Creative Coding: Flower Shower

link: https://a4-aditri-thakur.onrender.com/

This project is an interactive generative art demo where flower sprites move through a 3D environment using three.js and tweakpane. A control panel allows users to adjust the number of agents, their size, movement speed, and movement direction in real time. The main goal is to explore generative algorithms and  behaviors by simulating many small agents moving in a shared virtual space. 

A main cahlleneg I faced was performance optimization. I had to limit parameters to ensure the simulation runs smoothly even with hundreds of agents or fast speeds. 


Instructions:
- When you open the website, you’ll see a short overlay with basic instructions.
- Use the GUI at the top to adjust the following parameters:
  - Number of agents → adds or removes flowers.
  - Agent size → makes each flower sprite larger or smaller.
  - Agent speed → controls how quickly the flowers move through space.
  - Direction → changes the general movement bias of the group.
- Press X to close the instruction overlay at any time.

Additionally, resizing the browser window will cause the scene to automatically adjust.
