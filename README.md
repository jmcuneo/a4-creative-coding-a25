## Assignment 4 - Peter Czepiel

D3 Interactive Visualization: 'https://a4-peterczepiel-production.up.railway.app/'

### Overview

# Introduction: 
This program showcases an interactive visualization of sample data (taken from the Awesome JSON Datasets link in the original README) that users can interact with in several ways.

# Goal:
The goal of the application is to showcase the sample data in a way that is easy for users to understand and allows/encourages the user to transform the data to whatever way they see fit. I wanted to create a single visualization that used one of the 'complicated' techniques talked about on the D3.js. For this I chose to implement the zoom feature which aligned with the complicated techniques as it involved transforming, scaling, and dynamically rendering the data. I also wanted to make sure that the users had plenty of interaction, so I added all the sliders seen on the page itself.

# Challenges Faced:
One big challenge that I faced while making my application was learning how to use D3.js because I had never used it before. Specifically, the way that its functions are stuctured and the syntax behind that structure had a steep learning curve.

# Instructions:
1. npm install
2. npm start
3. Join localhost on specified port
4. Adjust the sliders of the graph in any way you want (make sure to test out the zoom)
5. Click the "Reset View" button to reset all page assets.
