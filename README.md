Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged when needed, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include the following:

- My application allows the user to generate a random 8 note loop sequence in the Dorian, Lydian, Mixolydian, and Phrygian musical modes. The user can switch between square, sawtooth, and triangle waveforms. They can also increaase or decrease the beats per minute.
- The main challenge was really learning the tone.js syntax and reminding myself of some music theory!
